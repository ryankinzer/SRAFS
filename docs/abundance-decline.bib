	abstract = {Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is a technique used to detect common patterns in a set of time series and relationships between these series and explanatory variables. Although DFA is used widely in econometric and psychological fields, it has not been used in fisheries and aquatic sciences to the best of our knowledge. To make the technique more widely accessible, an introductory guide for DFA, at an intermediate level, is presented in this paper. A case study is presented. The analysis of 13 landings-per-unit-effort series for Nephrops around northern Europe identified three common trends for 12 of the series, with one series being poorly fitted, but no relationships with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or sea surface temperature were found. The 12 series could be divided into six groups based on factor loadings from the three trends.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses dynamic factor analysis, a technique for estimating common trends in multivariate time series. Unlike more common time series techniques such as spectral analysis and ARIMA models, dynamic factor analysis can analyse short, non-stationary time series containing missing values. Typically, the parameters in dynamic factor analysis are estimated by direct optimisation, which means that only small data sets can be analysed if computing time is not to become prohibitively long and the chances of obtaining sub-optimal estimates are to be avoided. This paper shows how the parameters of dynamic factor analysis can be estimated using the EM algorithm, allowing larger data sets to be analysed. The technique is illustrated on a marine environmental data set.},

(1989). The list includes 214 native naturally-spawning stocks: 101 at high risk of extinction, 58 at moderate risk of extinction, 54 of special concern, and one classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and as endangered by the state of California. The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead. While some attempts at remedying these threats have been made, they have not been enough to prevent the broad decline of stocks along the West Coast. A new paradigm that advances habitat restoration and ecosystem function rather than hatchery production is needed for many of these stocks to survive and prosper into the next century.},

	abstract = {A guide to data collection, modeling and inference strategies for biological survey data using Bayesian and classical statistical methods.This book describes a general and flexible framework for modeling and inference in ecological systems based on hierarchical models, with a strict focus on the use of probability models and parametric inference. Hierarchical models represent a paradigm shift in the application of statistics to ecological inference problems because they combine explicit models of ecological system structure or dynamics with models of how ecological systems are observed. The principles of hierarchical modeling are developed and applied to problems in population, metapopulation, community, and metacommunity systems. The book provides the first synthetic treatment of many recent methodological advances in ecological modeling and unifies disparate methods and procedures.The authors apply principles of hierarchical modeling to ecological problems, including * occurrence or occupancy models for estimating species distribution* abundance models based on many sampling protocols, including distance sampling* capture-recapture models with individual effects* spatial capture-recapture models based on camera trapping and related methods* population and metapopulation dynamic models* models of biodiversity, community structure and dynamics* Wide variety of examples involving many taxa (birds, amphibians, mammals, insects, plants)* Development of classical, likelihood-based procedures for inference, as well asBayesian methods of analysis* Detailed explanations describing the implementation of hierarchical models using freely available software such as R and WinBUGS* Computing support in technical appendices in an online companion web site},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on riverine systems have, in part, led to management concerns regarding the population status of species using these systems. In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.},

Peak-period catches were estimated from mean catch weights during the five consecutive years of greatest total harvest, and from mean weights of fish reported in the early literature. These catches were 1,700,000 summer chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (1881â1885), 382,000 steelhead (1892â1896), 1,100,000 fall chinook salmon (1915â1919), 400,000 spring chinook salmon (approximately), 476,000 coho salmon O. kisutch (1894â1898), 1,915,000 sockeye salmon O. nerka (1883â1887), and 359,000 chum salmon O. keta (1915â1919). Optimum harvest rates for maximum sustained yield from nonhatchery stocks were obtained from literature: 0.77 for coho salmon, 0.73 for sockeye salmon, 0.68 for spring and summer chinook salmon, 0.88 for fall chinook salmon, 0.69 for steelhead, and 0.48 for chum salmon. Peak-period runs estimated from optimum harvest rates were 2,623,000 sockeye salmon, 4,338,000 chinook salmon, 618,000 coho salmon, 554,000 steelhead, and 748,000 chum salmonâ8,881,000 adults altogether. On the basis of the more probable harvest rates that produced overfishing (0.80â0.88), total run size was about 7,505,000 adults, a single best estimate of total predevelopment runs. I discuss aboriginal catch in relation to the theory that decimation of Indian populations after 1800 permitted salmon and steelhead stocks to expand. Using the shape of stock-recruitment functions and appropriate commercial harvest rates, I support the alternative hypothesis that salmon stocks actually decreased in the early 1800s with decreased Indian harvest, then increased after 1850 as commercial fisheries developed, and finally decreased in response to overfishing. Environmental degradation exacerbated the latter decrease.},

Here we describe a state-space model that estimates such escapement past a dam by using window counts, passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag observations and data from an adult fish trap, accounting for issues such as nighttime passage, fallback and re-ascension, potential observation error at the window and uncertainty in the adult trap rate. We tested the approach using a simulation framework that mimicked several levels of observation error, differences between nighttime passage and re-ascension rates and the possibility of the adult trap being closed for some period of time. Our results demonstrate that the model produced unbiased estimates across all tested scenarios. We also applied this model to empirical data from the Lower Granite Dam to produce estimates of wild, clipped hatchery and unclipped hatchery spring/summer-run Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and steelhead, O. mykiss, from spawn years 2010-2019.},

              Widespread declines in Atlantic and Pacific salmon (

              Oncorhynchus
              spp.) have tracked recent climate changes, but managers still lack quantitative projections of the viability of any individual population in response to future climate change. To address this gap, we assembled a vast database of survival and other data for eight wild populations of threatened Chinook salmon (
              O. tshawytscha
              ). For each population, we evaluated climate impacts at all life stages and modeled future trajectories forced by global climate model projections. Populations rapidly declined in response to increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors across diverse model assumptions and climate scenarios. Strong density dependence limited the number of salmon that survived early life stages, suggesting a potentially efficacious target for conservation effort. Other solutions require a better understanding of the factors that limit survival at sea. We conclude that dramatic increases in smolt survival are needed to overcome the negative impacts of climate change for this threatened species.},

Management of wild Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Snake River basin exemplifies the struggle to meet fisheries goals. Considering contemporary production of juvenile emigrants, it is imperative to determine the survival from emigration to adult (Se-a) required to meet abundance goals. Increased anthropogenic impact on spawning and rearing habitats leads to higher Se-a required to attain goals. Wilderness populations exhibit viability and could sustain fisheries with Se-a lower than required elsewhere. Conversely, populations targeted for habitat restoration demand higher Se-a to fulfill goals, indicating a need to enhance egg-to-smolt survival. However, Se-a has fallen below the threshold needed for replacement in all populations, even at current low abundances. Despite these challenges, most populations still possess the potential to achieve abundance goals, emphasizing the importance of strategic interventions to bolster their resilience.},

From this, we drew ten conclusions: (1) development of the Columbia River System (including the Snake River Basin) has converted mainstem rivers into reservoirs, altering ï¬sh behavior and survival; (2) most populations currently record their lowest abundance; (3) the Columbia River System dams reduce productivity of diadromous ï¬shes in the highest-quality spawning grounds that could buffer against future climate dynamics; (4) past actions have done little to reduce impacts or precipitate recovery; (5) the Columbia River System constrains survival and productivity of salmon, steelhead and Bull Trout; (6) Snake River Basin salmon and steelhead remain at high extinction risk; (7) eliminating migration impediments and improving mainstem habitats are essential for maintaining genetic diversity and improving Bull Trout persistence; (8) the lower Snake River Basin dams preclude passage of adult White Sturgeon, constraining gene ï¬ow and recruitment; (9) the lower Snake River Basin dams impede dramatically passage of adult and juvenile Paciï¬c Lamprey, and (10) Snake River Basin Paciï¬c Lamprey is at high risk of extirpation. Breaching the four lower Snake River Basin dams is an action likely to prevent extirpation and extinction of these ï¬shes.

            Declines in animal body sizes are widely reported and likely impact ecological interactions and ecosystem services. For harvested species subject to multiple stressors, limited understanding of the causes and consequences of size declines impedes prediction, prevention, and mitigation. We highlight widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska, the last largely pristine North American salmon-producing region. Declines in salmon size, primarily resulting from shifting age structure, are associated with climate and competition at sea. Compared to salmon maturing before 1990, the reduced size of adult salmon after 2010 has potentially resulted in substantial losses to ecosystems and people; for Chinook salmon we estimated average per-fish reductions in egg production (â16\%), nutrient transport (â28\%), fisheries value (â21\%), and meals for rural people (â26\%). Downsizing of organisms is a global concern, and current trends may pose substantial risks for nature and people.},

	abstract = {The Eastern, migratory population of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), an iconic North American insect, has declined by {\textasciitilde}80\% over the last decade. The monarchâs multi-generational migration between overwintering grounds in central Mexico and the summer breeding grounds in the northern U.S. and southern Canada is celebrated in all three countries and creates shared management responsibilities across North America. Here we present a novel Bayesian multivariate auto-regressive state-space model to assess quasi-extinction risk and aid in the establishment of a target population size for monarch conservation planning. We find that, given a range of plausible quasi-extinction thresholds, the population has a substantial probability of quasi-extinction, from 11â57\% over 20 years, although uncertainty in these estimates is large. Exceptionally high population stochasticity, declining numbers and a small current population size act in concert to drive this risk. An approximately 5-fold increase of the monarch population size (relative to the winter of 2014â15) is necessary to halve the current risk of quasi-extinction across all thresholds considered. Conserving the monarch migration thus requires active management to reverse population declines and the establishment of an ambitious target population size goal to buffer against future environmentally driven variability.},

A population collapse or quasi-extinction is defined to occur when the population size reaches some given lower density. If this density is chosen to be large enough for the demographic stochasticity to be ignored compared to environmental stochasticity, then the logarithm of the population size may be modelled by a Brownian motion until quasi-extinction occurs. The normal-gamma mixture of inverse Gaussian distributions can then be applied to define prediction intervals for the time to quasi-extinction in such processes. A similar mixture is used to predict the population size at a finite time for the same process provided that quasi-extinction has not occurred before that time. Stochastic simulations indicate that the coverage of the prediction interval is very close to the probability calculated theoretically. As an illustration, the method is applied to predict the time to extinction of a declining population of white stork in southwestern Germany.},

	abstract = {Disentangling the influences of climate change from other stressors affecting the population dynamics of aquatic species is particularly pressing for northern latitude ecosystems, where climate-driven warming is occurring faster than the global average. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (YK) region occupy the northern extent of their species' range and are experiencing prolonged declines in abundance resulting in fisheries closures and impacts to the well-being of Indigenous people and local communities. These declines have been associated with physical (e.g., temperature, streamflow) and biological (e.g., body size, competition) conditions, but uncertainty remains about the relative influence of these drivers on productivity across populations and how salmonâenvironment relationships vary across watersheds. To fill these knowledge gaps, we estimated the effects of marine and freshwater environmental indicators, body size, and indices of competition, on the productivity (adult returns-per-spawner) of 26 Chinook salmon populations in the YK region using a Bayesian hierarchical stock-recruitment model. Across most populations, productivity declined with smaller spawner body size and sea surface temperatures that were colder in the winter and warmer in the summer during the first year at sea. Decreased productivity was also associated with above average fall maximum daily streamflow, increased sea ice cover prior to juvenile outmigration, and abundance of marine competitors, but the strength of these effects varied among populations. Maximum daily stream temperature during spawning migration had a nonlinear relationship with productivity, with reduced productivity in years when temperatures exceeded thresholds in main stem rivers. These results demonstrate for the first time that well-documented declines in body size of YK Chinook salmon were associated with declining population productivity, while taking climate into account.},

	abstract = {Conservation planning for rare and threatened species is often made more difficult by a lack of research and monitoring data. In such cases, managers may rely on qualitative assessments of species risk that lack explicit acknowledgement of uncertainty. Snakes are a group of conservation concern that are also notoriously difficult to monitor. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative population projection for a data-deficient species, the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus) using expert knowledge and published information about species life history and threats to persistence. Using this model, we simulated population dynamics over 30 years under four scenarios of future urbanization and found that there was an increased probability of population decline as urbanization rates increased. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of outcomes to model inputs, a practice that may also be useful in recovery planning. The sensitivity analyses also provide insight into how the future trajectories would change if the elicited demographic rates are incorrect. Even when data are sparse, quantitative methods can often be used to produce rigorous and reproducible estimates of future status with quantifiable uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Decisions about whether to designate a species for conservation and protection depend on the ability to summarize their population trajectories and their risk of extinction. Such decisions may rely on quantitative population viability analyses based on a time series of abundance index values that are derived from a monitoring program. In the case of the Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), a decision to protect a distinct population segment of the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act was informed by several indices of population abundance. In this paper, we combined individual population viability analyses into a single metric for extinction risk using a meta-analysis framework. Individual monitoring surveys for this species generally agreed that the trajectory of abundance was downward, but variation introduced uncertainty. Combining data from several surveys produced a better summary of the population growth rate. We also used the population growth rates in a simulation to estimate the probability that the abundance of Longfin Smelt dropped too low to recover. We found that this probability of quasi-extinction was substantial, exceeding 20Â \% over two decades. This study demonstrates a practical way that having multiple sources of information creates better information about the trajectory of a population. Individually, the surveys contribute information about specific life stages or ages to our understanding of the population. Combined into one metric and an associated graphical summary, this analysis succinctly communicates risk and creates a benchmark for evaluating future management decisions.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species was increasingly used during the 1980s to assess the conservation status of species for policy and planning purposes. This use stimulated the development of a new set of quantitative criteria for listing species in the categories of threat: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. These criteria, which were intended to be applicable to all species except microorganisms, were part of a broader system for classifying threatened species and were fully implemented by IUCN in 2000. The system and the criteria have been widely used by conservation practitioners and scientists and now underpin one indicator being used to assess the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010 biodiversity target. We describe the process and the technical background to the IUCN Red List system. The criteria refer to fundamental biological processes underlying population decline and extinction. But given major differences between species, the threatening processes affecting them, and the paucity of knowledge relating to most species, the IUCN system had to be both broad and flexible to be applicable to the majority of described species. The system was designed to measure the symptoms of extinction risk, and uses 5 independent criteria relating to aspects of population loss and decline of range size. A species is assigned to a threat category if it meets the quantitative threshold for at least one criterion. The criteria and the accompanying rules and guidelines used by IUCN are intended to increase the consistency, transparency, and validity of its categorization system, but it necessitates some compromises that affect the applicability of the system and the species lists that result. In particular, choices were made over the assessment of uncertainty, poorly known species, depleted species, population decline, restricted ranges, and rarity; all of these affect the way red lists should be viewed and used. Processes related to priority setting and the development of national red lists need to take account of some assumptions in the formulation of the criteria.},

	abstract = {For millennia humans have extracted biological and physical resources from the planet to sustain societies and enable the development of technology and infrastructure. Growth in the human population and changing consumption patterns have increased the human footprint on ecosystems and their biodiversity, including in fresh waters. Freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity face many threats and it is now widely accepted that we are in a biodiversity crisis. One means of protecting and restoring freshwater biodiversity is to better manage the exploitation of freshwater biota and aggregate resources (e.g., sand, gravel, and boulders). Here we outline the threats arising from such exploitation and identify response options to ensure that methods and levels of extraction are sustainable and allow recovery of over-exploited freshwater biodiversity and ecosystems. The guidance we provide will enable practitioners, policy-makers, and resource stewards to embrace effective, sustainable, and evidence-based approaches to resource extraction. Response options for managing species exploitation include strengthening assessment and reporting, using science-based approaches to reduce overexploitation and support recovery, embracing community engagement, and building or tightening legislation. Response options for managing exploitation of freshwater aggregate resources include reducing demand for harvest, strengthening governance, reporting, and monitoring of environmental impacts, and promoting the restoration of degraded ecosystems or compensating for losses. Diverse case studies highlight examples of where various management actions have been implemented in an effort to consider how they can be scaled up and adapted to other contexts. Managing exploitation will be a key aspect of broader initiatives needed to protect and restore freshwater biodiversity around the globe.},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are highly biodiverse1 and important for livelihoods and economic development2, but are under substantial stress3. To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods4,5 are used to guide environmental policy6 and conservation prioritization7, whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors8â13. However, there is evidence14â17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals18,19. Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales.},

	abstract = {The 2020 edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture has a particular focus on sustainability. This reflects a number of specific considerations. First, 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (the Code). Second, several Sustainable Development Goal indicators mature in 2020. Third, FAO hosted the International Symposium on Fisheries Sustainability in late 2019, and fourth, 2020 sees the finalization of specific FAO guidelines on sustainable aquaculture growth, and on social sustainability along value chains. While Part 1 retains the format of previous editions, the structure of the rest of the publication has been revised. Part 2 opens with a special section marking the twenty fifth anniversary of the Code. It also focuses on issues coming to the fore, in particular, those related to Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its indicators for which FAO is the âcustodianâ agency. In addition, Part 2 covers various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture sustainability. The topics discussed range widely, from data and information systems to ocean pollution, product legality, user rights and climate change adaptation. Part 3 now forms the final part of the publication, covering projections and emerging issues such as new technologies and aquaculture biosecurity. It concludes by outlining steps towards a new vision for capture fisheries. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and up-to-date information to a wide audience â policymakers, managers, scientists, stakeholders and indeed everyone interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.},

	abstract = {Global climate change is shifting the timing of life-cycle events, sometimes resulting in phenological mismatches between predators and prey. Phenological shifts and subsequent mismatches may be consistent across populations, or they could vary unpredictably across populations within the same species. For anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), juveniles from thousands of locally adapted populations migrate from diverse freshwater habitats to the Pacific Ocean every year. Both the timing of freshwater migration and ocean arrival, relative to nearshore prey (phenological match/mismatch), can control marine survival and population dynamics. Here we examined phenological change of 66 populations across six anadromous Pacific salmon species throughout their range in western North America with the longest time series spanning 1951â2019. We show that different salmon species have different rates of phenological change but that there was substantial within-species variation that was not correlated with changing environmental conditions or geographic patterns. Moreover, outmigration phenologies have not tracked shifts in the timing of marine primary productivity, potentially increasing the frequency of future phenological mismatches. Understanding population responses to mismatches with prey are an important part of characterizing overall population-specific climate vulnerability.},

	abstract = {A decline in size is increasingly recognised as a major response by ectothermic species to global warming. Mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood but could include changes in energy balance of consumers, driven by declines in prey size coupled with increased energy demands due to warming. The sardine Sardina pilchardus is a prime example of animal shrinking, European populations of this planktivorous fish are undergoing profound decreases in body condition and adult size. This is apparently a bottom-up effect coincident with a shift towards increased reliance on smaller planktonic prey. We investigated the hypothesis that foraging on smaller prey would lead to increased rates of energy expenditure by sardines, and that such expenditures would be exacerbated by warming temperature. Using group respirometry we measured rates of energy expenditure indirectly, as oxygen uptake, by captive adult sardines offered food of two different sizes (0.2 or 1.2Â mm items) when acclimated to two temperatures (16Â Â°C or 21Â Â°C). Energy expenditure during feeding on small items was tripled at 16Â Â°C and doubled at 21Â Â°C compared to large items, linked to a change in foraging mode between filter feeding on small or direct capture of large. This caused daily energy expenditure to increase by {\textasciitilde}10Â \% at 16Â Â°C and {\textasciitilde}40Â \% at 21Â Â°C on small items, compared to large items at 16Â Â°C. These results support that declines in prey size coupled with warming could influence energy allocation towards life-history traits in wild populations. This bottom-up effect could partially explain the shrinking and declining condition of many small pelagic fish populations and may be contributing to the shrinking of other fish species throughout the marine food web. Understanding how declines in prey size can couple with warming to affect consumers is a crucial element of projecting the consequences for marine fauna of ongoing anthropogenic global change.},

	abstract = {In the face of biodiversity loss worldwide, it is paramount to quantify species' extinction risk to guide conservation efforts. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List is considered the global standard for evaluating extinction risks. IUCN criteria also inform national extinction risk assessments. Bayesian models, including the state-of-the-art JARA (âJust Another Red List Assessmentâ) tool, deliver probabilistic statements about species falling into extinction risk categories, thereby enabling characterisation and communication of uncertainty in extinction risk assessments. We coupled the state-of-the-art VAST (âVector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporalâ) modelling tool and JARA, for better informed Red List assessments of marine fishes. In this framework, VAST is fitted to scientific survey catch rate data to provide indices to JARA whose uncertainty is propagated to JARA outcomes suggesting extinction risk categories (under the population reduction criterion). In addition, VAST delivers a valuable habitat assessment to better understand what may be driving extinction risk in the study region. Here, we demonstrate the coupled VAST-JARA modelling framework by applying it to five contrasting North Sea species, with or without a quantitative stock assessment and with different conservation statuses according to the latest global Red List assessments. The North Sea application coupled with previous assessments and studies suggest that, among the three elasmobranchs, starry ray is in most need of urgent research (and conservation actions where appropriate), followed by spurdog, while lesser-spotted dogfish is increasing in biomass. Moreover, both the VAST-JARA modelling framework and previous research indicate that, while European plaice is not of conservation concern, cod has likely met the IUCN criteria for being listed as Endangered recently. Synthesis and applications. The predictions of the VAST-JARA modelling framework for North Sea species, including JARA output and VAST habitat assessment, constitute valuable supporting information to make interpretations based on Red List guidelines, which will help decision-makers in their next North Sea Red List assessment. We foresee applications of the modelling framework to assist Red List assessments of numerous marine fishes worldwide. Our modelling framework has many potential advantageous uses, including informing resource management about climate change impacts on species' extinction risks.},

	abstract = {Declines in populations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in the Pacific Northwest have led to listings under the Endangered Species Act. One objective of current recovery efforts is the restoration of freshwater and estuarine habitats, which had been occurring prior to Endangered Species Act listing but increased dramatically afterwards. However, few listed populations are improving. We believe that there are five factors contributing to the lack of population response to habitat restoration: Not enough restoration has been done. We are not doing the right things in the right places at the right times. Ongoing habitat degradation is offsetting restoration benefits. Not enough time has passed. Monitoring has been inadequate to detect changes in Pacific salmon abundance. All factors contribute to the disappointing progress on Pacific salmon recovery, although their importance varies. Two factors are more consistently significant than the others. Resources available to address habitat damage remain insufficient. The scale of the problem is large, so the response needs to be correspondingly large to yield desired outcomes. Of equal significance is the failure of restoration programs to identify elements controlling fish production. Implementing the right projects in the right places is key to improving the outcomes of restoration.},

	abstract = {Along the northeast Pacific coast, the salmon-eating southern resident killer whale population (SRKW, Orcinus orca) have been at very low levels since the 1970s. Previous research have suggested that reduction in food availability, especially of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), could be the main limiting factor for the SRKW population. Using the ecosystem modelling platform Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE), this study evaluated if the decline of the Pacific salmon populations between 1979 and 2020 may have been impacted by a combination of factors, including marine mammal predation, fishing activities, and climatic patterns. We found that the total mortality of most Chinook salmon populations has been relatively stable for all mature returning fish despite strong reduction in fishing mortality since the 1990s. This mortality pattern was mainly driven by pinnipeds, with increases in predation between 1979 and 2020 mortality ranging by factors of 1.8 to 8.5 across the different Chinook salmon population groups. The predation mortality on fall-run Chinook salmon smolts originating from the Salish Sea increased 4.6 times from 1979 to 2020, whereas the predation mortality on coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolts increased by a factor of 7.3. The model also revealed that the north Pacific gyre oscillation (NPGO) was the most important large-scale climatic index affecting the stock productivity of Chinook salmon populations from California to northern British Columbia. Overall, the model provided evidence that multiple factors may have affected Chinook salmon populations between 1979 and 2020, and suggested that predation mortality by marine mammals could be an important driver of salmon population declines during that time.},

Perhaps, the most broadly tractable and effective factors affecting diadromous fishes are removals of the dams that prevent or hinder their migrations, alter their environment, and often favor non-native biotic communities.

	abstract = {Efforts to reverse the decline have been extensive and expensive, but have not met with much success. Salmon in the lower 48 states are well on their way to attaining a status enjoyed by some of their notable brethren â wolves, condors, grizzles, bison â wild animals that are unlikely to disappear entirely, but struggle to hang on as remnants of once flourishing species in small portions of their original range. A few entrepreneurs may be marketing the superior taste of buffalo burgers, but wild bison today are found only in Yellowstone and a few other refuges. This prediction will not surprise anyone familiar with the state of wild salmon runs. Consider the following facts: in California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and southern British Columbia, many runs are reduced to less than 10\% of their historical numbers; some have disappeared. Many salmon runs are dominated by hatchery-bred fish. Even for the Columbia River, once the mightiest salmon-producing river south of Canada, over 80\% of the total run is now comprised of hatchery-bred fish. Every few years, there is a media celebration of ârecordâ salmon runs, but these temporary blips are due mainly to favorable ocean conditions coupled with a recalibration of what constitutes a ârecordâ run. If doubling a run from 2\% to 4\% of the historical level qualifies as a record run, then we are often there, however modest the increase may be. More sobering, the majority of such runs are usually hatchery-bred fish. Nowadays wild salmon comprise less than a quarter of many West Coast salmon runs. People in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia remain concerned about the decline of the once immense salmon runs. Billions of dollars already have been spent in a so-far failed attempt to reverse the long-term decline, which is largely due to altered or inaccessible freshwater and estuarine habitat. The option of using hatcheries to maintain runs is another story, but given the limited quantity and quality of spawning and rearing habitat now available to salmon, the region will not support self-reproducing runs of wild salmon even remotely like those of the 1840s. The pattern of salmon decline is not unique to western North America. Of the Earthâs four regions where salmon runs occurred historically (Asian Far East, Atlantic Europe, eastern North America, and western North America), it appears probable that salmon runs in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia, Wild salmon in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia.},

	abstract = {Stateâspace models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and captureârecapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. We present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

	abstract = {Sharks and rays are key functional components of coral reef ecosystems, yet many populations of a few species exhibit signs of depletion and local extinctions. The question is whether these declines forewarn of a global extinction crisis. We use IUCN Red List to quantify the status, trajectory, and threats to all coral reef sharks and rays worldwide. Here, we show that nearly two-thirds (59\%) of the 134 coral-reef associated shark and ray species are threatened with extinction. Alongside marine mammals, sharks and rays are among the most threatened groups found on coral reefs. Overfishing is the main cause of elevated extinction risk, compounded by climate change and habitat degradation. Risk is greatest for species that are larger-bodied (less resilient and higher trophic level), widely distributed across several national jurisdictions (subject to a patchwork of management), and in nations with greater fishing pressure and weaker governance. Population declines have occurred over more than half a century, with greatest declines prior to 2005. Immediate action through local protections, combined with broad-scale fisheries management and Marine Protected Areas, is required to avoid extinctions and the loss of critical ecosystem function condemning reefs to a loss of shark and ray biodiversity and ecosystem services, limiting livelihoods and food security.},

	abstract = {Previous meta-analysis of spawnerârecruit relationships suggested that depensatory behaviour is uncommon, and stocks pushed to low abundance are unlikely to suffer decreases in recruitment more severe than would be expected based on the decline in spawning stock. Using an updated database that has over 100 stocks that were depleted to less than 20\% of their maximum observed stock size, we tested for depensatory behaviour in both total surplus production and recruitment and we also examined the probability of stock increase as a function of stock size and fishing pressure. The number of stocks that showed a significant improvement with depensatory models was less than that expected by chance. Hierarchical meta-analysis showed that the majority of the evidence was for no depensatory behaviour but could not rule out depensation at very low stock sizes. Stocks that are depleted to low abundance are expected to rebuild when fishing pressure is reduced if the environment has not changed but there is considerable evidence that the majority of fish stocks are impacted by changes in productivity regimes. Nevertheless, if stocks are very heavily depleted and fishing pressure is not reduced to quite low levels, the expected recovery time is both uncertain and long. Very low abundance should clearly be avoided for many reasons and the range of abundance where depensation cannot be ruled out is well below commonly adopted limit reference points.},
